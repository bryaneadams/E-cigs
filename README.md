# E-cigs
Are E-cigs good for you?  No...  This is a project in conjunction with Pennington Biomedical Research Center.  We are looking at current trends in E-cigs usage.  

## Image scrape from Google

We would like to build a data base of e-cig images to begin the process of developing a neural network for identifying the brand of e-cig.  The file `E_Cig_Image_scrape.rmd` is the first attempt.
